    "Without a doubt, big data is the driving force behind recommender systems. A good recommendation engine should be reliable, scalable, highly available, and be able to provide personalized recommendations, in real time, to the large user base it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a typical recommendation system cannot do its job without sufficient data and big data supplies plenty of user data such as past purchases, browsing history, and feedback for the Recommendation systems to provide relevant and effective recommendations. In a nutshell, even the most advanced recommender systems cannot be effective without big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of big data and improvements in technology, both on the software and hardware front, goes beyond just supplying massive data. It also provides meaningful, actionable data fast, and provides the necessary setup to quickly process the data in real time."
